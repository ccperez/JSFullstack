# JSFullstack

This sample demo application came from a free static template that compose of Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and JS. 
Which my aim intention is to show my coding style pattern on how I convert it to Javascript Fullstack 
using Nodejs, Express and Reactjs with PGSQL for the database.

* Coding Pattern:
  - Small components and function-specific.
  - Reusable component, that use other components.
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) eliminating duplicate codes.
  - Naming the component by function name and capitalize
  - Separate stateful aspects from rendering. 
  
* Restful API for Backend

* Redux for State Management

* Knex for SQL query builder 

* Enable the Contact function

* Introduce the Authentication concept.
